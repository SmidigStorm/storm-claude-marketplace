# Analyze

Your task is to analyze and understand what the user wants to achieve.

## Instructions

1. Carefully read and consider the user's request or problem statement
2. Ask clarifying questions if the request is ambiguous or missing important details
3. Identify the core goal and any sub-goals
4. Consider constraints, requirements, and context

## Output

Create `temp-claude-plans/` folder if it doesn't exist, then save your analysis to `temp-claude-plans/analysis.md`.

The analysis should include:

- **Goal**: A clear, one-sentence statement of what the user wants to achieve
- **Key Requirements**: Bullet points of the main requirements or constraints
- **Scope**: What is included and what is explicitly out of scope
- **Assumptions**: Any assumptions you're making based on the request

Keep the summary brief and actionable. This analysis will be used as input for the planning phase.
