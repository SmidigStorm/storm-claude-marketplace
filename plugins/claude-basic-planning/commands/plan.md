description: Create an implementation plan after understanding the codebase

# Plan

Your task is to create a detailed implementation plan to solve the user's need.

## Instructions

1. **Read the analysis** - Start by reading `temp-claude-plans/analysis.md` to understand the goal

2. **Explore the codebase** - Before planning, read and understand the current repository:
   - Identify relevant files and directories
   - Understand existing patterns, conventions, and architecture
   - Find where changes need to be made

3. **Create an implementation plan** that includes:
   - Step-by-step tasks to achieve the goal
   - Which files need to be created, modified, or deleted
   - Dependencies between tasks (what must happen first)
   - Any potential risks or challenges

## Output

Save your plan to `temp-claude-plans/plan.md` with this structure:

- **Overview**: Brief summary of the approach
- **Steps**: Numbered list of implementation steps, each with:
  - What needs to be done
  - Which files are affected
  - Any considerations or notes
- **Risks**: Potential issues and how to mitigate them

Do NOT start implementing yet. This plan will be reviewed before execution.
