# Execute

Your task is to execute the implementation plan that was created.

## Instructions

1. **Read the plan** - Start by reading `temp-claude-plans/plan.md`
2. **Follow the plan** - Execute each step from the plan in order
3. **Track progress** - Use the todo list to mark tasks as you complete them
4. **Stay focused** - Only implement what was planned, avoid scope creep
5. **Verify each step** - Ensure each step works before moving to the next
6. **Report issues** - If you encounter problems, note them and adapt as needed

## Guidelines

- Complete tasks sequentially unless they can safely run in parallel
- Test changes when appropriate
- Commit logical units of work if requested
- If the plan needs adjustment, explain why before deviating

## Output

As you work, provide brief status updates. When complete, save a summary to `temp-claude-plans/execution-summary.md` with:

- **Completed**: What was implemented
- **Changes made**: List of files created/modified
- **Issues**: Any problems encountered and how they were resolved
- **Next steps**: Any follow-up actions needed (if applicable)
